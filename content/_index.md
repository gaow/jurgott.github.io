Dr. Jurg Ott is a renowned scholar and pioneer in the field of human genetic linkage analysis. Ott was born and raised in Switzerland, where he also received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Zurich. Subsequently, he obtained an M.S. degree in Biomathematics from the University of Washington in Seattle. From 1986-1996, he was a professor at Columbia University in New York, departments of Psychiatry and Genetics & Development. From 1996-2009 he was a Professor at Rockefeller University in New York, where he is now a Professor Emeritus and Head of Laboratory. In Beijing, he served as a professor at the Beijing Institute of Genomics CAS through 2010 and moved to the Institute of Psychology CAS as a Visiting Professor in 2011.

## Computer Programs

- [RunPM](programs/run-pm) A wrapper for `pseudomarker`, which combines linkage and association analysis and treats marker allele frequencies as nuisance parameters
  - [Download](https://github.com/jurgott/RunPM")
- [GPM](programs/gpm) A suite of programs for genotype pattern mining, i.e. evaluation of all pairs of genotypes and testing whether their frequencies differ in cases and controls. Users can apply these programs, or their own programs, to published datasets.
- [DNT](programs/dnt) Based on genotype pairs obtained from GPM above, DNT finds SNPs significantly connected with other SNPs.
  - [Download](https://github.com/jurgott/gpm_dnt")
- [Genetic case-control data](https://github.com/jurgott/gpm_data) previously published in my lab.
