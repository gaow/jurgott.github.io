## Description
HAPLOTTER is a web application that has been developed to display the results of a scan for positive selection in the human genome using the HapMap data. It can be used as a resource to examine various population genetic measures in a genomic region. Measures that are currently displayed include iHS (a statistic developed to detect recent positive selection), Fay and Wu's H, Tajima's D and Fst.
