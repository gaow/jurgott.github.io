Pedigree RElationship Statistical Test

## Description
PREST is a program that detects pedigree errors in general outbred pedigrees by use of genome-screen data. When a potential pedigree error is detected, our companion program, ALTERTEST, determines which relationships are compatible with the observed genotype data. Both programs are freely available on the web.
