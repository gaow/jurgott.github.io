# MAPINSPECT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
May 2002 (previously called MAPCOMP)

## Description
MAPINSPECT can be used to compare linkage maps obtained from different sources/populations/etc.. It will draw the linkage maps and look for common marker names, these are then connected in the drawing with dashed lines. All neighboring maps are compared in this way. Images can be printed and saved. Orders of the MAPs (ie which map is compared with which other map) can be changed and maps can be flipped (right mouse button). remark: MapComp bears close relationships with the GGT software package
