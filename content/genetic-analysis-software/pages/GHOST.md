# GHOST
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
GHOST is a software package for family-based genomewide association (GWA) analysis, with the ability to infer missing genotypes using the Elston-Stewart algorithm. When SNPs from an association panel are less complete (i.e., having more missing genotypes) than markers from a linkage panel, many of the missing genotypes can be determined. GHOST can handle large pedigrees -- when pedigrees are small, Merlin is also recommended for this analysis.
