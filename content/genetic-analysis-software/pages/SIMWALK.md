# SIMWALK
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Other Name
SIMWALK/SIMCROSS

## Version
SIMCROSS: June 1995; SIMWALK2: 2.91 (December 2004)

## Description
programs for generating optimal haplotype configurations on general pedigrees using a likelihood-based approach to correctly take intermarker recombination fractions into account. simcross ignores untyped parts of the pedigree, and it uses simulated annealing. simwalk combines simulated annealing with random walk method.

## Author
