## Description
The program implements the Mantel statistics as proposed by Beckmann et al. (2005) to test for association between genetic markers and phenotypes in case-control studies using haplotype information. The potential value of haplotypes has attracted widespread interest in the mapping of complex traits. Haplotype sharing methods take into account linkage disequilibrium information between multiple markers, and may have good power to detect predisposing genes. We present a new approach based on Mantel statistics for space time clustering, which we developed in order to improve the power of haplotype sharing analysis for gene mapping in complex disease. The new statistic correlates genetic similarity and phenotypic similarity across pairs of haplotypes for case-only and case-control studies. The genetic similarity is measured as the shared length between haplotypes around a putative disease locus. Alternative measures for the phenotypic similarity were implemented.
