Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.2 (June 2006)

## Description
Ordering markers when the number of loci is large is a special case of the traveling salesman problem. ANTMAP is a system based on the Ant Colony Optimization to solve this problem. ANYMAP performs segregation test, linkage grouping and locus ordering, and constructs a linkage map rapidly.
