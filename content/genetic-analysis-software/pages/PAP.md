## Full Name
Pedigree Analysis Package

## Version
6.0 (December 2006)

## Description
it can perform (1) compute the likelihood of specified parameter values; (2) compute the probability of each genotype for pedigree members; (3) simulate phenotypes for output into files; (4) maximize the likelihood over specified parameters (with or without standard errors); (5) compute the standard errors of parameters for unknown estimates; (6) simulate phenotypes and estimate parameter values; (7) estimate expected lod score; (8) compute a grid of likelihood over one or two parameters. New additions to V5: assortative mating; TDT; additive multi-locus models
