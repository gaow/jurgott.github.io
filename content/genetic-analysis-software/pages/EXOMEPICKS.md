# EXOMEPICKS
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
ExomePicks is a program that suggests individuals to be sequenced in a large pedigree. ExomePicks assumes that a genotyping chip or another cost effective means will be used to determine IBD sharing in the pedigree and that, subsequently, one would like to sequence a minimal number of individuals and use their sequences together with IBD information to deduce the sequence of other individuals in the pedigree. We are currently using it in the context of whole exome and whole genome sequencing studies to pick individuals to be sequenced from large family collections.
