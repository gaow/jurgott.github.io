# SNPFILE
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
SNPFile is a library and API for manipulating large SNP datasets with associated meta-data, such as marker names, marker locations, individuals' phenotypes, etc. in an I/O efficient binary file format. In its core, SNPFile assumes very little about the metadata associated with markers and individuals, but leaves this up to application program protocols.
