## Full Name
Combined Annotation scoRing toOL

## Description
CAROL is a combined functional annotation score of non-synonymous coding variants. A major challenge in interpreting whole-exome data is predicting which of the discovered variants are deleterious or neutral. To address this question in silico, we have developed a score called Combined Annotation scoRing toOL (CAROL),which combines information from two bioinformatics tools: PolyPhen-2 and SIFT, in order to improve the prediction of the effect of non-synonymous coding variants. The combination of annotation tools can help improve automated prediction of whole-genome/exome non-synonymous variant functional consequences.
