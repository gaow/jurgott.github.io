## Full Name
(haplotype) Family Based Association Test

## Version
Nov 2003

## Description
Haplotype FBAT is a user-friendly, well-documented software that allows the user to test for association/linkage between disease phenotypes and haplotypes by utilizing family-based controls. The method extends the approach for testing described in Rabinowitz and Laird (2000) to handle multiple tightly linked markers. It is robust to population admixture, yet efficient in the sense that it utilizes data from families where phase cannot be completely resolved in all individuals by using weights, which are estimated from the sample. However, the method remains robust to population stratification and population admixture. The method can handle any type of phenotype, including multiple phenotypes and missing parents, marker data, and/or phase, and provides both bi-allelic and multi-allelic tests. PowerFBAT is a tool for power simulation of association analysis using FBAT with binary outcomes. XWXW is an extension to the Haseman-Elston method for non-parametric linkage test with quantitative traits. XDT is a software that performs classical TDT, "SDT" and "Rabinowitz TDT" for nuclear families (not supported anymore).
