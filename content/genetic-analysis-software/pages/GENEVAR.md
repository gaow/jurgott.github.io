## Full Name
GENe Expression VARiation

## Description
Genevar is a database and Java tool designed to integrate multiple datasets, and provides analysis and visualization of associations between sequence variation and gene expression in eQTL studies. Genevar allows researchers to investigate eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) associations within a gene locus of interest in real time. The database and application can be installed on a standard computer in database mode and, in addition, on a server to share discoveries among affiliations or the broader community over the internet via web services protocols.
