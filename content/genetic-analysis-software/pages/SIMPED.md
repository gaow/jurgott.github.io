# SIMPED
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
SimPed is a program that quickly generates haplotypes and/or genotype data for a large number of marker loci (>20,000) for pedigrees of virtually any size and complexity. Haplotypes and/or genotypes are generated using user specified genetic map distances and haplotypes and/or allele frequencies.
