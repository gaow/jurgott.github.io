## Version
1.0.7 (September 28, 2009)

## Description
The Path web application is a first-step bioinformatics approach to investigate gene-gene interactions in genetic association studies. Path is designed to do: 1\. Interface your SNP data with biological information from several online bioinformatics databases. 2. Generate biologically plausible hypotheses for testing gene-gene interactions. 3\. Select a subset of SNPs and conduct SNP-SNP interaction tests. 4\. Store analysis results. 5\. Explore analysis results through interactive plots and summary tables.
