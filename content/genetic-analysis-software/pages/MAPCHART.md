## Full Name
Windows software for the graphical presentation of linkage maps and QTLs

## Version
2.2

## Description
Produces charts of genetic linkage and QTL data. The charts are composed of a sequence of vertical bars representing the linkage groups or chromosomes. On these bars the positions of loci are indicated, and next to the bars QTL intervals and QTL graphs can be shown. MapChart reads the linkage information (i.e. the locus and QTL names and their positions) from text files. Many options to adapt the charts to different purposes. Can produce graphic files (enhanced windows metafile format) which can be enhanced with other MS-Windows software.
