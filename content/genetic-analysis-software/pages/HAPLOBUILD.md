# HAPLOBUILD
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
The analysis of large amounts of SNP data creates difficulties for the analysis of haplotypes and their association to traits of interest. Commonly fairly simple methods, such as two- or three-SNP sliding windows are used to create haplotypes across large regions, but these may be of limited value when adjacent SNPs are in strong LD and provide redundant information. We have created a novel program, "HaploBuild" for constructing and testing haplotypes for SNPs in close physical proximity to one another but which are not necessarily contiguous. Furthermore, the number of SNPs contained in the haplotype is not restricted, thereby permitting the evaluation of complex haplotype structures.
