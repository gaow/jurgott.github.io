## Full Name
Genetic Association Interaction Analysis

## Version
1.1 (2006)

## Description
GAIA is an easy to use, web-based application for testing for locus-locus interaction using genetic association. It is based upon the case-control study design and is designed so that non-specialists may routinely apply tests for interaction. GAIA allows simple testing of both additive and additive plus dominance interaction models and includes permutation testing to appropriately correct for multiple testing. The application is useful for both candidate gene based studies and genome-wide association studies. For large scale studies GAIA includes a screening approach which prioritizes loci for further interaction analysis.
