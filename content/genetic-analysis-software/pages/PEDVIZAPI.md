## Description
PEDVIZAPI is a Java Api for the visual analysis of large and complex pedigrees. It provides all the necessary functionality for the interactive exploration of extended genealogies. Available packages are mostly focused on a static representation or cannot be added to an existing application; the goal of this open-source library is to provide an application program interface that enables the efficient construction of visual analytic applications for the analysis of family based data.
