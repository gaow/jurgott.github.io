## Description
SIMLAPLOT is a tool designed to help visualize the joint effect of genes and continuous environmental covariates on complex human disease simulation models. SIMLAPLOT takes as input the set of genetic model parameters used to generate the data, including risk ratios for genotypes (G), a normally distributed environmental covariate (E) and their interaction (GxE), or the risk ratio for a continuous covariate that is itself influenced by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) and thus follows a mixture normal distribution. It is also possible to use SIMLAPLOT to plot observed data distributions, if estimates of these parameters can be provided.
