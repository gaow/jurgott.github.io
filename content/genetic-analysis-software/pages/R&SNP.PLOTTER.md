## Description
snp.plotter is an R package that creates publishable-quality plots of p-values using single SNP and/or haplotype data. Main features of the package include options to display a linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot and the ability to plot multiple sets of results simultaneously. Plots can be created using global and/or individual haplotype p-values along with single SNP p-values. Images are created as either Portable Document Format (PDF) or Encapsulated (EPS) files.
