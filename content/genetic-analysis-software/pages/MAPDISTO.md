## Version
v1.7.0 (October 2007)

## Description
MAPDISTO is a program for mapping genetic markers in experimental segregating populations like backcross, doubled haploids, single-seed descent. Its specificity is to propose recombination fraction estimates in case of segregation distortion. It can (1) compute and draw genetic maps easily and quickly through a graphical interface; (2) facilitate the analysis of marker data showing segregation distortion due to differential viability of gametes or zygotes.
