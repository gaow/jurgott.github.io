## Full Name
Suite of Nucleotide Analysis Programs

## Description
The exploration of DNA sequence variation for making inferences on evolutionary processes in populations requires the coordinated implementation of a Suite of Nucleotide Analysis Programs (SNAP), each bound by specific assumptions and limitations. We have developed a workbench tool to make existing population genetic software more accessible and to facilitate the integration of new tools for analyzing patterns of DNA sequence variation, within a phylogenetic context. Collectively, SNAP tools can serve as a bridge between theoretical and applied population genetic analysis.
