# MARGARITA
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
Margarita infers genealogies from population genotype data and uses these to map disease loci. These genealogies take the form of the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). The ARG defines a genealogical tree for each locus, and as one moves along the chromosome the topologies of consecutive trees shift according to the impact of historical recombination events.
