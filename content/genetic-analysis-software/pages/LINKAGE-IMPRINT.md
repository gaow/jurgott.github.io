# LINKAGE-IMPRINT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
LINKAGE allowing for IMPRINITING

## Version
January 2005

## Description
We have developed a parametric model-based approach to analyzing pedigree data for genomic imprinting. We have modified widely used LINKAGE program to incorporate imprinting. In addition, the LINKAGE-IMPRINT program allows for the use of sex-specific recombination in the analysis, which is of particular importance in a genome-wide analysis for imprinted genes.
