Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
0.1.0 (April 2005)

## Description
Simultaneously estimate a trait-locus position and its genetic effects for affected relative pairs (ARP) by one of two methods. Either allow a different trait-locus effect for each ARP type, or constrain the trait-locus effects according to the marginal effect of a single susceptibility locus. We include a goodness of fit statistic for the constrained model.
