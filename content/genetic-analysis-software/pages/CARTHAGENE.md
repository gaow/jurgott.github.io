# CARTHAGENE
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.0 (January 2006)

## Description
It is a genetic/radiation hybrid mapping software. CARTHAGENE looks for multiple populations maximum likelihood consensus maps using a fast EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation and powerful ordering algorithms inspired from TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) technology. It can handle large data sets made up of different populations (either F2 backcross, recombinant inbred lines, F2 intercross, phase known outbreds, haploid/diploid radiation hybrids). It can also exploit existing syntenic relationships between the organism mapped and a reference (sequenced) organism for accurate dense RH mapping.
