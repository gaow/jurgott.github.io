## Full Name
Berkeley method for Perfect Phylogeney Haplotyping

## Version
April 2003

## Description
a program for inferring haplotypes from genotypes to determine if there are resulting haplotypes that fit a tree model (i.e. a perfect phylogeny, a coalescent). In population genetic terms, BPPH determines whether a set of SNP genotypes can be explained by haplotype pairs that could have evolved on a coalescent under the no-recombination, infinite sites model.
