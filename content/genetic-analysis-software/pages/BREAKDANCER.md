# BREAKDANCER
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
BreakDancer provides genome-wide detection of structural variants from next generation paired-end sequencing reads. BreakDancerMax predicts five types of structural variants: insertions, deletions, inversions, inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations from next-generation short paired-end sequencing reads using read pairs that are mapped with unexpected separation distances or orientation.
