# WEBQTL
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
An interactive web site useful for exploring the genetic modulation of thousands of phenotypes gathered over a 30-year period by hundreds of investigators using reference panels of recombinant inbred strains of mice. WebQTL includes dense error-checked genetic maps, as well as extensive gene expression data sets (Affymetrix) acquired across more than 35 strains of mice. WebQTL accepts user-entered traits for BXD, AXB/BXA, CXB, BXH, AKXD recombinant inbred strains.
