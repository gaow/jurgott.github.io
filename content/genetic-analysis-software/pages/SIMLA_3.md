# SIMLA 3
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
3.2, 3.3 with graphic user interface

## Description
SIMLA is a simulation program that generates data sets of families for use in linkage and association studies. SIMLA_3.2 is a major upgrade to versions 2.3 and 3.0 that provides the ability to simulate two disease loci and two environmental covariates. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may also be simulated which jointly determine the disease risk of all pedigree members.
The SIMLA3.3 with Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed for users to set up the SIMLA parameters conveniently. The GUI assists in creating a SIMLA control file based on the parameters specified on the GUI panels. It includes the SIMLA 3.2 program version.
