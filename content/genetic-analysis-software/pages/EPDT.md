## Full Name
Extended Pedigree Disequilibrium Test

## Version
1.0 (2004)

## Description
EPDT is a major advancement in detecting linkage/disequilibrium signals # between genetic markers and disease loci, particularly if only one # or a few large pedigrees are available. The strategy differs from # conventional approaches that require at least a moderate number of # families to attain adequate statistical power. The proposed testing # procedure is advantageous in that it provides high statistical power # coupled with reduced sample collection. Furthermore, the proposed # method avoids problems such as potential population stratification # and genetic heterogeneity, and is robust with respect to misspecification # of phenotype.
