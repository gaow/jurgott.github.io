# ACT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Analysis of Complex Traits

## Version
1.1 (Mar 17, 2000)

## Description
It contains the following modules: ibd, calculates the proportion of gene shared identical by decent for a nuclear family; ibdn, (modified program of ERPA), which implements a method for assessing increased-allele sharing between all pairs of affected relatives within a pedigree; multic, multivariate analysis for complex traits; ml, estimation of variance components using maximum likelihood; ql, estimation of variance components using quasi likelihood; relcov, generates first degree relationship coefficients for extended families; sim2s, the simulation program that was used to test ACT; cage, Cohort Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology; gh: GeneHunter, heavily modified to assist multipoint calculation using multic; TDT: TDT programs written in SAS; gcc and f77 compilers are necessary. Executable programs are included for compatible operating systems, i.e., Solaris2.6.
