## Full Name
SNP Missing data STATistics

## Version
4.0

## Description
SNPMStat is a command-line program for the statistical analysis of SNP-disease association in case-control/cohort/cross-sectional studies with potentially missing genotype data. SNPMStat allows the user to estimate or test SNP effects and SNP-environment interactions by maximizing the (observed-data) likelihood that properly accounts for phase uncertainty, study design and gene-environment dependence. For SNPs without missing data, the program performs the standard association analysis. For typed SNPs with missing data or untyped SNPs, the program performs the maximum-likelihood analysis.
