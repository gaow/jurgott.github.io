# RC-TDT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Reconstruction-Combined Transmission Disequilibrium Test

## Version
1.1d (Jul 2006)

## Description
A family-based association method that allows testing for linkage in the presence of linkage disequilibrium between an autosomal marker and a disease even if there is only incomplete parental-marker information. Recently, Horvath et al. (2000) described a similar procedure (XRC-TDT) for X-linked markers. The distribution contains SAS macros that calculate the RC-TDT and XRC-TDT test statistics, as well as their respective exact P values.
