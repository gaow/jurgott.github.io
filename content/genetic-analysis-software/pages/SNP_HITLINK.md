Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
SNP HIgh-Throughput LINKage analysis system

## Version
5.1 (May 2010)

## Description
SNP HiTLink is a computer program providing a useful pipeline to directly connect SNP data and linkage analysis program. SNP HiTLink currently supports the data from SNP chips provided by Affymetrix (Mapping 100k/500k array set, Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0/6.0) and Illumina (recently supported), carrying out typical linkage analysis programs of MLINK (FASTLINK/ LINKAGE package), Superlink, Merlin and Allegro.
