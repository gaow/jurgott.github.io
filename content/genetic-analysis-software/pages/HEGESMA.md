## Full Name
HEterogeneity and GEnome Search Meta Analysis

## Description
HEGESMA is a comprehensive software for performing genome scan meta-analysis, a quantitative method to identify genetic regions (bins) with consistently increased linkage score across multiple genome scans, and for testing the heterogeneity of the results of each bin across scans. The program provides as an output the average of ranks and three heterogeneity statistics, as well as corresponding significance levels.
