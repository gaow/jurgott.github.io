## Full Name
functional ANNOtation of genetic VARiants

## Version

## Description
ANNOVAR is an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from diverse genomes (including human genome hg18, hg19, as well as mouse, worm, fly, yeast and many others). Given a list of variants with chromosome, start position, end position, reference nucleotide and observed nucleotides, ANNOVAR can perform: 1\. gene-based annotation. 2\. region-based annotation. 3\. filter-based annotation. 4\. other functionalities.
