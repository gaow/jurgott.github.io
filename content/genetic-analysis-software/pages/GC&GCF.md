Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Genomic Control

## Description
GC implements the genomic control models. GCF implements the basic Genomic Control approach, but adjusts the p-values for uncertainty in the estimated effect of substructure. This approach is preferable if a large number of tests will be evaluated because it provides a more accurrate assessment of the significance level for small p-values.
