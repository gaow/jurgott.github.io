## Full Name
Multi-Cross QTL mapping

## Version
v4.0

## Description
The aim of the MCQTL software package is to perform QTL mapping in multi-cross designs. It allows the analysis of the usual populations derived from inbred lines and can link the families by assuming that the QTL locations are the same in all them. Moreover, a diallel modelling of the QTL genotypic effects is allowed in multiple related families. Obviously, the analysis of a single cross is also feasible.
