# COVIBD
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
CovIBD refines linkage analysis of affected sibpairs by considering attributes or environmental exposures thought to affect disease liability. This refinement utilizes a mixture model in which a disease mutation segregates in only a fraction of the sibships, with the rest of the sibships unlinked. Covariate information is used to predict membership within the two groups corresponding to the linked and unlinked sibships. The pre-clustering model uses covariate information to first form two probabilistic clusters and then tests for excess IBD-sharing in the clusters. The Cov-IBD model determines probabilistic group membership by joint consideration of covariate and IBD values.
