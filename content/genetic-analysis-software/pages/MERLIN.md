## Full Name
Multipoint Engine for Rapid Likelihood INference

## Version
1.0.1

## Description
Merlin carries out single-point and multipoint analyses of pedigree data, including IBD and kinship calculations, nonparametric and variance component linkage analyses, error detection and information content mapping. For multipoint analyses in dense maps, Merlin allows the user to impose constraints on the number of recombinants between consecutive markers. Merlin estimates haplotypes by finding the most likely path of gene flow or by sampling paths of gene flow at all markers jointly. It can also list all possible nonrecombinant haplotypes within short regions. Finally, Merlin provides swap-file support for handling very large numbers of markers as well as gene-dropping simulations for estimating empirical significance levels.
