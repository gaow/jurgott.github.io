## Full Name
Secondary Phenotype REGression analysis

## Version
2.0

## Description
SPREG is a computer program for performing regression analysis of secondary phenotype data in case-control association studies. Secondary phenotypes are quantitative or qualitative traits other than the case-control status. Because the case-control sample is not a random sample of the general population, standard statistical analysis of secondary phenotype data can yield very misleading results. SPREG implements valid and efficient statistical methods.
