# RELATIVEFINDER
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
relativeFinder is a program for checking relationships between pairs of individuals. There are many excellent programs that carry out similar tasks. Some of the unique features in relativeFinder are the batch mode options, that allow large jobs to be divided into many smaller jobs (suitable for deployment on a compute cluster environment), and the flexibility of the underlying Merlin engine, which allows relative finder to handle large pedigrees and consider a variety of alternate relationships -- including potential relationships specified by the user on the fly.
