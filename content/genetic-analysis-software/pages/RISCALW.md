## Full Name
RISk CALculation in Windows

## Description
RISCALW is a novel convenient Windows program for risk calculation in families with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is based on an extended genetic model which includes germline mosaicism and different new mutation rates depending on sex and mutation type. Arbitrary family structures and additional diagnostic information like genotypes from intragenetic and flancing genetic markers of the dystrophin gene, creatin kinase values and female deletion test results can be taken into account.
