# GRIDQTL
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.5.1 (August 2010)

## Description
A publicly available Web-based application that can perform QTL mapping on a variety of population types. GridQTL will extend the functionality of QTLExpress by adding new and advanced approaches for modelling QTL analysis in simple and complex populations. These new methods will be available on a Grid system that will offer flexible workflow management, resource allocation, data persistence, detached execution of simulations and the scalability required for the increase in data volume, data sources and complexity required by the new models.
