# LAMP
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Linkage and Association Modeling in Pedigrees

## Version
0.0.9

## Description
LAMP carries out parametric association analysis in samples of unrelated individuals, trios or large families. In addition to a test-statistic, a genetic model is estimated for each SNP. The approach is based on retrospective likelihood and can be used to analyze selected samples.
