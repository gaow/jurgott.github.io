# QUANTO
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.2.1 (January 2007)

## Description
Quanto is a program that computes sample size or power for association studies of genes, environmental factors, gene-environment interaction, or gene-gene interaction. Available study designs for a disease (binary) outcome include the unmatched case-control, matched case-control, case-sibling, case-parent, and case-only designs. Study designs for a quantitative tra it include independent individuals and case parent designs. Quanto is a 32-bit Windows application requiring Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME or XP to run. The graphical user interface allows th e user to easily change the model and view the results without having to edit an input file and rerun the program for every model. The results of a session are stored to a log file. This log can be printed or saved to a file for reviewing at a later date. An option is included to create a text file of the log that can be imported into other documents.
