Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
0.6.8

## Description
PEDSTATS does error checking and data summary of large or small data sets in QTDT, LINKAGE or MENDEL format. Checks for basic formatting errors, disconnected family groups, ancestor-descendant loops and can detect all Mendelian (including X-linked) inheritance errors in any pedigree without loops. Produces text and graphical (PDF) summaries of the family structure, trait and marker information of pedigree data and can break down summaries by sex, relative pair type or family. PEDSTATS also does Hardy-Weinberg testing using either a fast exact or asymptotic test and can summarize information in text or graphical PDF format. Additional features include a number of options for filtering data prior to summary and checks for inappropriate age or covariate values. Lastly, PEDSTATS can identify and trim uninformative individuals from a pedigree and rewrite the reorganized data to a new pedigree file.
