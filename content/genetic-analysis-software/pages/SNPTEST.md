## Description
SNPTEST is a program for the analysis of single SNP association in genome-wide studies. The tests implemented can cater for binary (case-control) and quantitative phenotypes, can condition upon an arbitrary set of covariates and properly account for the uncertainty in genotypes. The program is designed to work seamlessly with the output of both the genotype calling program CHIAMO, the genotype imputation program IMPUTE and the program GTOOL. This program was used in the analysis of the 7 genome-wide association studies carried out by the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC).
