Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
HAPSIMU is based on real haplotype data from the HapMap ENCODE project. This platform can simulate heterogeneous populations with various known and controllable structures under the continuous migration model or the discrete model. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative traits can be simulated using additive genetic model with various genetic parameters designated by users.
