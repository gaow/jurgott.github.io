## Full Name
a Java based LINkage disequilibrium plotter

## Version
1.5.2 (March 2006)

## Description
JLIN (Java LINkage disequilibrium plotter) is designed for customisable, intuitive visualisation of LD analysis across all common computing platforms. Customisation allows the researcher to choose particular visualisation, statistical measures and measurement ranges. JLIN also allows the researcher to export images of the LD visualisation in several common document formats. As there appears to be no single best measure of LD under all possible circumstances, JLIN allows the researcher to visually compare and contrast the results of a range of statistical measures on the input data set(s). These measures include the commonly used D' and R2 statistics and empirical p-values. New additions include calculation of HWE, a completely revamped interface, and a numer of minor bug fixes. We have added a display measure to show marker distances visually, embedded fonts to improve image clarity and additional LD measures including d,OR,Pexcess and Q.
