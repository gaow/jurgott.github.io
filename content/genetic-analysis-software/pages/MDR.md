## Full Name
Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction

## Version
2.0 beta 6

## Description
MDR is a data mining strategy for detecting and characterizing nonlinear interactions among discrete attributes (e.g. SNPs, smoking, gender, etc.) that are predictive of a discrete outcome (e.g. case-control status). The MDR software combines attribute selection, attribute construction and classification with cross-validation to provide a powerful approach to modeling interactions.
