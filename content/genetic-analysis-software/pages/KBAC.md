## Full Name
Kernal Based Association for Rare Variants

## Description
This program implements the KBAC statistic in Liu and Leal (2010). It carries out case-control association testing for rare variants for whole exome association studies. Briefly, consider a gene of length N which harbors M rare variants. Genotype on the M variant sites & the disease status (case/control) are known for each individual. The program takes as input the M-site genotype and disease status (case/control) data files, and computes a p value indicating the significance of association. In order to speed up permutation testing we use an “adaptive” approach to obtain p values.
