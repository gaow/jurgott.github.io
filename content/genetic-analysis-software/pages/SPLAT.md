# SPLAT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Sib Pair Linkage Analysis Testing

## Version
1.0 (2006)

## Description
SPLAT can calculate virtually any linkage test statistic under several sib pair study designs: affected, discordant, unaffected, and pairs defined by threshold values for quantitative traits, such as extreme discordant sib pairs. It uses the EM algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates of sharing (subject to any user-specified domain restrictions or null hypotheses) and then plots lod scores versus chromosomal position. It includes a novel grid scanning capability that enables simultaneous visualization of multiple test statistics. Phenotype definitions can be modified without recalculating inheritance vectors, thereby providing considerable analytical flexibility.
