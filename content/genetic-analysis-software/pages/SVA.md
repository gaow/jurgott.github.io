Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Sequence Variant Analyzer

## Version
v1.10 (March 2011)

## Description
SVA is a software tool that assigns a predicted biological function to variants identified in next-generation sequencing studies and provides a browser to visualize the variants in their genomic contexts. SVA also provides for flexible interaction with software implementing variant association tests allowing users to consider both the bioinformatic annotation of identified variants and the strength of their associations with studied traits.
