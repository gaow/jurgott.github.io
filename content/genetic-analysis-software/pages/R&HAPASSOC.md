# R/HAPASSOC
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.2-4 (July 2010)

## Description
a likelihood approach is used to inference of haplotype and nongenetic effects and their interactions in generalized linear models of disease penetrance, when haplotype phase is unknown for some subjects. Parameter estimates are obtained by use of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and standard errors are calculated using Louis' formula.
