## Full Name
Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines

## Version
4.0.7 (December 2006).

## Description
OLAR is a flexible and extensive software package for genetic variance components analysis, including linkage analysis, quantitative genetic analysis, and covariate screening. Operations are included for calculation of marker-specific or multipoint identity-by-descent (IBD) matrices in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity, and for linkage analysis of quantitative traits which may involve multiple loci (oligogenic analysis), dominance effects, and epistasis.
