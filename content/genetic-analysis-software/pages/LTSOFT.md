# LTSOFT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.0 beta

## Description
LTSOFT is a software suite designed to more powerfully leverage clinical-covariates such as age, bmi, smoking status, and gender when conducting case-control association studies. Including these covariates in standard regression models is not only suboptimal, but can in many instances reduce power. LTSOFT employs a liability threshold model approach that takes advantage of known epidemiological results to better model the covariates' relationship to the phenotype of interest
