# MEGA2
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
a Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analyses

## Version
3.0 R9 (July 2006)

## Description
Mega2 uses as input a trio of files: 1) a LINKAGE-format locus file modified to contain locus name information; 2) a LINKAGE-format pedigree file; and 3) a map file. Mega2 then takes this trio of input files and, via a menu-driven interface, transforms them into various other file formats, thus greatly facilitating a variety of different analyses. In addition, for many of these options, it also sets up a C-shell script that then can automatically run these analyses (if you are using Mega2 in a Unix environment that supports C-shell scripts).
