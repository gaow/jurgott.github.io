# SDMINP
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Step-Down MIN P-value

## Version
1.0 (December 2005)

## Description
SDMinP is an easy-to-use program for fast calculation of empirical and adjusted p-values for correlated and uncorrelated hypotheses in multiple testing experiments. It is based on the Free Step-Down Resampling Method for controlling the Family Wise Error Rate, originally proposed by Westfall and Young (1993), and implements a variation of the efficient algorithm of Ge et al. (2003), in which the originally necessary re-sampling effort was reduced considerably and the method made computationally more feasible. The program is independent of the underlying test statistic and works with provided observed and permutation test statistics.
