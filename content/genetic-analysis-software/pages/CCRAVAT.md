## Full Name
Case-Control RAre Variant Analysis Tool

## Description
Enabling the analysis of rare variants in large-scale case control and quantitative trait association studies. CCRaVAT (Case-Control Rare Variant Analysis Tool) and QuTie (Quantitative Trait) are software packages that enable efficient large-scale analysis of rare variants across specific regions or genome-wide. These programs implement a rare variant super-locus or collapsing method that investigates the accumulation of rare variant alleles in either a case-control or quantitative trait study design.
