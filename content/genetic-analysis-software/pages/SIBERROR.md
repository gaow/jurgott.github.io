## Description
SibError is an algorithm that identifies pedigree errors in sibship data. Examples include half siblings, unrelated individuals, identical twins, and parental exclusions. The test statistic is based on the summation of the number of alleles shared by a pair of relatives for a large number of markers and the number of alleles and allele frequencies for those markers.
