## Full Name
Testing Haplotype EffectS In Association Studies

## Version
3.1 (March 2006)

## Description
The objective of the THESIAS program is to perform haplotype-based association analysis in unrelated individuals. This program is based on a maximum likelihood model described in Tregouet et al. 2002 and is linked to the stochastic EM (SEM) algorithm. THESIAS allows the simultaneous estimation of haplotype frequencies and of their associated effects on the phenotype of interest. In its current version, both quantitative and qualitative phenotypes can be studied. Covariate-adjusted haplotype effects as well as haplotype x covariate interactions can be investigated.
