# PDT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
pedigree disequilibrium test

## Version
5.1

## Description
The PDT analysis program allows the user to evaluate evidence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in general pedigree data. All family data may be used without nullifying the validity of the association test, even when there is more than one affected in a family. The PDT program performs both allele-specific and genotype-specific LD analysis of individual markers. Version 5.1 adds the ability to perform genotype-specific analysis over marker sets.
