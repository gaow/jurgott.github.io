# GENEFINDER
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
1.1.9 (June 2004)

## Description
GeneFinder uses GEE method to estimate the location of the susceptibility gene based on the allele-sharing of affected sib pairs for multiple markers. GENEFINDER can further the analysis of GENEHUNTER by providing a more accurate gene location estimation and the corresponding confidence interval.
