## Full Name
Decay of Haplotype Sharing MAPping software

## Version
2.0 (October 18, 2001)

## Description
DHSMAP is a program for fine-mapping of qualitative traits by linkage disequilibrium. Given a set of marker haplotypes or genotypes from affected individuals, haplotypes or genotypes from appropriately selected controls, and a genetic map of the markers at which both sets of individuals are typed, DHSMAP estimates the location of the trait-associated variant by maximum likelihood or maximum quasi-likelihood.
