## Description
INTERSNP is a software for genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA) of case-control SNP data. SNPs are selected for joint analysis using a priori information. Sources of information to define meaningful strategies can be statistical evidence (single marker association at a moderate level, computed from the own data) and genetic/biologic relevance (genomic location, function class or pathway information).
