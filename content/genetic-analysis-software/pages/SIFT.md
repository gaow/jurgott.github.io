# SIFT
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant

## Description
SIFT predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids. SIFT can be applied to naturally occurring nonsynonymous polymorphisms and laboratory-induced missense mutations.
