# EASYLINKAGE/EASYLINKAGE-PLUS
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
5.02

## Description
easyLINKAGE combines automated setup and performance of linkage analyses and simulation under an easy to handle graphical user interface for Microsoft Windows 2000/XP and standard UNIX systems. The program package supports currently single-point linkage analyses (FastLink, SPLink, SuperLink), multi-point linkage analyses (GeneHunter, GeneHunter Plus, GeneHunter-Imprinting/-TwoLocus, Allegro, SimWalk, Merlin), and the simulation package SLink, and provides genome-wide as well as chromosomal postscript plots of LOD scores, NPL scores, P values, and many other parameters. The software can analyze STRPs as well as SNP chip data from Affymetrix, Illumina, or self-defined SNP data. The program performs single- and multi-point simulation studies.
