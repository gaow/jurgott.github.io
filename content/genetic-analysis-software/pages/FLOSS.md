# FLOSS
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
FLexible Ordered SubSet analysis

## Version
1.4.1

## Description
FLOSS performs ordered subset analysis using MERLIN's ouput ".lod" file created with the --perFamily option. Ordered subset analysis uses covariate information to identify a more homogenous subset of families for linkage analysis. The homogeneous subset of families does not need to be specified a priori, and the covariates can include environmental exposures, quantitative traits, or linkage scores at another locus in the genome. The evidence for linkage is evaluated with a permutation test.
