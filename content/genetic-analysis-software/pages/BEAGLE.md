Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Version
3.2.1 (May 2010)

## Description
BEAGLE is a state of the art software package for analysis of large-scale genetic data sets with hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped on thousands of samples. BEAGLE can
* phase genotype data (i.e. infer haplotypes) for unrelated individuals, parent-offspring pairs, and parent-offspring trios
* infer sporadic missing genotype data
* impute ungenotyped markers that have been genotyped in a reference panel
* perform single marker and haplotypic association analysis
* detect genetic regions that are homozygous-by-descent in an individual or identical-by-descent in pairs of individuals.
