# HOMOZYGOSITYMAPPER
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Description
A web-based approach of homozygosity mapping that can handle tens of thousands markers. User can upload their own SNP genotype files to our database. Intuitive graphic interface is provided to view the homozygous stretches, with the ability of zooming into single chromosomes or user-defined chromosome regions. The underlying genotypes in all samples are displayed. The software is also integrated with our candidate gene search engine, GeneDistiller, so that users can interactively determine the most promising gene.
