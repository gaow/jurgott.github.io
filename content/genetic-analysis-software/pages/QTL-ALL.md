# QTL-ALL
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
QTL Analysis and Linkage Library

## Description
QTL-ALL is a software package designed to make as many as possible of the new statistics (e.g. score statistics) widely available. The software consists of a MEGA2-like interface for data analysis preparation and a library of R routines that computes linkage statistics. QTL-ALL reads in input data, creates re-formatted output data files, calls external IBD-generation software such as MERLIN or SIMWALK2, then computes statistics using our R library, and finally produces tables and plots of statistics and p-values. This entire sequence is highly automated, requiring minimal user-intervention. The initial release of the software computes a number of newer QTL-mapping statistics, including several score statistic variants, and can handle nuclear family data, including specialty designs such as discordant and concordant (affected) pairs.
