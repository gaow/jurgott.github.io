## Full Name
SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test

## Description
SKAT is a SNP-set (e.g., a gene or a region) level test for association between a set of rare (or common) variants and dichotomous or quantitative phenotypes. SKAT aggregates individual score test statistics of SNPs in a SNP set and efficiently computes SNP-set level p-values, e.g. a gene or a region level p-value, while adjusting for covariates, such as principal components to account for population stratification. SKAT also allows for power/sample size calculations for designing for sequence association studies.
