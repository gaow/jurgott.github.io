## Full Name
SIMulation-based HAPlotypic analysis

## Version
1.0.2 (January 2009)

## Description
SimHap uses biallelic SNP genotype data to impute haplotype frequencies at the individual level. SimHap also tests for haplotype associations with outcomes of interest while incorporating the uncertainty around inferred haplotypes into the modelling procedure. SimHap allows epidemiological (ie, non-genetic) and both single SNP and haplotype association analyses of quantitative Normal, binary, longitudinal and right-censored outcomes under a range of genetic models. SimHap can accommodate large data sets, and can model genetic and environmental effects, including complex haplotype:environment interactions. SimHap features cross-platform functionality via Java, and a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI). SimHap will also perform association analysis on more simple epidemiological models, with or without the inclusion of genetic covariates.
