Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Consensus Assessment of Sequence And VAriation

## Version
v1.6

## Description
Illumina's CASAVA software captures summary information for resequencing and counting studies and places the data in a compact structure for visualization within GenomeStudio Software or publicly available analysis tools. CASAVA can create genomic builds, call SNPs, detects indels, and count reads from data generated from one or more runs of the Genome Analyzer across a broad range of sequencing applications.
v.1.6 highlights:
* complete secondary analysis software package, including facilities for alignment, reference-guided assembly, SNP/indel calling and counting for RNA applications.
* new methods for gapped, multiseed alignments that reduce artifactual mismatches.
* new indel detection method, and improved SNP calling on longer Genome Analyzer reads.
