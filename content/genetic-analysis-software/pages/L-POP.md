## Description
L-POP detects population stratification in samples of unrelated individuals for whom a number of unlinked genotypes have been measured.
Using a latent class analysis model, population strata are defined such that unlinked markers are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium within classes.
L-POP calculates the posterior probabilities for each individual belonging to each of K classes, which can be used to correct for spurious effects of population stratification in tests of association.
