# MPDA
Record added by Jurg Ott (the original Rockefeller list)

## Full Name
Microarray Pooled DNA Analyser

## Version
2.1 (March 2008)

## Description
MPDA is an innovative tool for analyzing hybridization intensity data from microarray-based pooled DNA experiments. MPDA was developed under the software platform, MATLABR, and provided user-friendly interfaces adapted to Windows systems (Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows XP). or users without installing software MATLABR, we also developed stand-alone executables generated via the MATLABR compiler. MPDA provides four major functions: (1) Whole-genome DNA amplification/hybridization analysis, (2) Allele frequency estimation, (3) Association mapping, (4) Allelic imbalance detection. Graphic and numerical outputs from MPDA support global and detailed inspection for bulk of genomic data.
