## Description
simuPOP is a forward-based population genetics simulation program. It is capable of simulating very complex evolution processes on large (think of millions) populations. Major features include variable population size; many built-in and hybrid (write in python) mutation, migration, selection models. simuPOP can be extended in Python so there is no limit on what you can do with it.
